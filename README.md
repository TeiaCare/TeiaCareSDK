```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "teiacare/sdk/observable.hpp"

int main() 
{
    auto callback = [](int value){ std::cout << "Update: " << value << "\n"; };
    auto observable = tc::sdk::observable<int>(-1, callback);
    
    constexpr int total_updates = 10;

}
```


## Getting Started

**Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m venv .venv

# Linux
echo "export CONAN_USER_HOME=$PWD" >> .venv/bin/activate
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
echo set CONAN_USER_HOME=%CD%>>.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

**Setup Build Environment (Windows Only)**

When building from command line on Windows it is necessary to activate the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
Depending on the version of Visual Studio compiler and on its install location it is required to run *vcvars64.bat* script the set the development environment properly.  
*Note*: using Visual Studio IDE or the CMake extension for VSCode this step is already managed in the background.  

Examples

```bash
# Visual Studio 2022 - Build Tools
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"

# Visual Studio 2019 - Enterprise
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"

Documentation is now installed in $PWD/install/docs.

## Conan Package - Local Install
```bash
git clone https://teiacare@dev.azure.com/teiacare/Ancelia/_git/TeiaCoreSDK
cd TeiaCoreSDK

# Create, test and install local package
# Notes:
# 1) The install_dir path must be the parent directory of a valid Conan cache (i.e. ".conan" folder)
#    So, in order to install the package in the Conan cache of the current repository, it is required to set --install_dir $PWD
# 2) The Conan package tests are automatically run during package creation.
#    The directory test_package contains a test project that is built to validate the proper package creation.
python ./scripts/conan/create.py <Debug|Release> <COMPILER_NAME> <COMPILER_VERSION> --install_dir <INSTALL_DIR_PATH>
```

## Conan Package - Test
```bash
git clone https://teiacare@dev.azure.com/teiacare/Ancelia/_git/TeiaCoreSDK
cd TeiaCoreSDK
cd sdk_package_test

# Build and install the test package executable at $PWD/install/teiacore_sdk_client_package_test
python build.py <Debug|Release> <COMPILER_NAME> <COMPILER_VERSION> 

# Run it
$PWD/install/teiacore_sdk_client_package_test
```
